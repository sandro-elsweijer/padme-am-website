					<h2 class="section-title">Overall Research Goals</h2>
					<p>Additive manufacturing (AM) has gained more and more momentum in recent
						years, but has yet to fullfil the promise of becoming the widely used
						break-through-technology that will revolutionize manufacturing in the
						21st century. Despite all the advantages, such as the high degree of
						design freedom and the shortened production time for highly complex
						parts, additively manufactured components are still hardly used in
						safety-relevant areas. This is due to the fact that, compared to
						conventional processes such as milling, the processes are significantly
						more complex and the material quality of the manufactured component
						cannot be predicted with certainty. Time-consuming and costly quality
						control requirements prevent the widespread use of AM. These issues can
						in principle be overcome by advanced modeling and simulation of the
						manufacturing process which will then allow to optimize the process.</p>
						<p>For the design of AM components and for the simulation of a Laser Powder
						Bed Fusion (L-PBF) process, solutions are offered by various software
						vendors, such as Siemens, Altair or ANSYS. However, these solutions
						reflect the low level of maturity of the still young 3D printing
						technologies. Their capabilities are not sufficient to obtain accurate
						process control. In order to be able to obtain the required accuracy, a
						multiscale and multidisciplinary approach is required that combines
						experimental and theoretical work with computer simulations on multiple
						length scales.</p>
						<p>The simulation of the L-PBF process involves various
						challenges. Obviously, the domain evolves during the process by adding
						additional layers of powder. Moreover, multiple phase changes need to be
						resolved, from powder to liquid and from liquid to solid, since a direct
						conversion from powder to solid is not possible. Material phases form
						and transform during subsequent laser passes. Furthermore, this extremly
						complex environment is truely a multiscale process. The laser heat
						source is highly localized (about 100 micron) and in case of AMB laser
						sources may require the resolution of even further details.
						Yet, the printed product is typically on the scale of decimeters and
						scale separation in L-PBF is not given due to the intermediate powder bed
						layer scale. Similarly, a large range of time scales is involved and
						needs to be resolved appropriately. While local melting and
						solidification takes place within milliseconds, the complete
						manufacturing of a final part may require multiple days. Finally, we
						need to deal with all of these challenges on computational domains which
						shape and topology may be extremely complex and change substantially
						over time.</p>

						<p>Eamples for the multiscalarity of
						additive manufacturing: a) raw powder, b) melt pool monitoring (MPM)
						data for a single melted layer and the corresponding light optical
						image; c) MPM data of a small cuboid exhibiting different
						microstructures; d) MPM data and image of a larger component. (source:
						DLR)</p>
						<p>Overall, the L-PBF process constitutes a multi-physics problem, where the
						largest temperature gradients are induced by the moving and highly
						localized laser beam which in turn yield the phase changes in close
						vicinity of the beam. The involved phase changes are typically modeled

						<p>The simulation environment to be developed is intended to cover all
						relevant scales in the long term from the powder level to the entire
						component. In order to build up a process simulation tool that can be
						expanded and is suitable for research, a high degree of flexibility in
						the modeling is important. This will also include the implementation of
						variable beam profiles such as e.g. from new Ringmode-lasers (Figure 1)
						that are not yet standard in AM processes. At the same time, as much as
						possible should be built on existing simulation modules. Therefore, a
						meshfree partition of unity method (PUM), a generalization of the finite
						element method (FEM), with which multiscale partial differential
						equations can be solved on complex geometries, offers an ideal basis for
						such a development. In contrast to classical FEM, a meshing of the
						simulation domain can be omitted. Local refinements and free surfaces
						can be easily represented. Finally, the basis functions of the PUM, from
						which the solution is constructed, can be enriched by domain knowledge,
						experimental results, AI building blocks or further simulation results.
						Thus, the multiscale underlying additive manufacturing can be achieved
						by local refinements in the PUM, enrichment of the basis functions, and
						by uni- or bidirectional co-simulation with other simulation tools. As a
						first step in the course of the project, we want to answer the question
						how the heat input by the lasers at powder level is transferred to the
						overall component.</p>

					    <h2 class="subsection-title">Sustainability</h2>
					    <p>
					    The PADME-AM project is focused on advancing the field of AM by integrating sustainability principles and bridging the gap between mathematical simulations and real-world applications. The project recognizes the importance of sustainability in AM and aims to enhance the environmental and economic aspects of the L-PBF process.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    Sustainability in AM is a crucial consideration due to the significant material and energy requirements involved in the manufacturing process. PADME-AM addresses this challenge by developing a systematic approach to optimize the L-PBF process for improved sustainability. By reducing material waste, minimizing energy consumption, and optimizing process parameters, the project aims to enhance the overall efficiency and environmental footprint of AM.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    A key aspect of the project is the transfer of mathematical results and simulations into real-world application. The mathematical models and simulations developed within PADME-AM will be validated and refined through experimental investigations. This iterative process ensures that the mathematical predictions align with the actual behavior of the L-PBF process.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    Furthermore, the project emphasizes the development of an industrially viable simulation environment. This environment will allow manufacturers to effectively implement the insights gained from mathematical models and simulations into their production processes. By integrating the expertise of multiple stakeholders, including additive manufacturing researchers, industry partners, and simulation developers, the project aims to create a user-friendly and scalable simulation platform.
					    </p>
					    <p>
					    Ultimately, the goal of PADME-AM is to contribute to a more sustainable future for additive manufacturing. By combining mathematical modeling, experimental validation, and real-world implementation, the project aims to optimize the L-PBF process for improved sustainability and facilitate the widespread adoption of environmentally conscious additive manufacturing practices.
